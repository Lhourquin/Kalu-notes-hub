# Daemon

## What is a Daemon ?

* A daemon is a special type of process that runs in the background and is not directly interacted with by the user.
* Daemons perform various tasks like handling network request, system logging, or scheduling jobs
* They are typically initiated at system startup and run continuously until the system is shut down.
* They do not have a graphical user interface.
* An example of a daemon is the `httpd` daemon that manages the Apache server or the `sshd` daemon for secure shell services.

So, while all daemons are processes, not all processes are daemons.
